This is the video for the final project of ME 231A: Experimential Advanced Control Design I offered during the Fall 2019 semester at University of California, Berkeley. This project used Model Predictive Control to optimize trajectories of a bipedal robot, Cassie and let it walk a sine-wave path. This MPC controller is based on the FlatGround Controller developed by University of Michigan
